该题型也在 IELTS 考试中出现，所以以下内容参考了之前编写的 IELTS 写作课程文档。

不过从侧重点上看，IELTS 考试中的图表作文更侧重于对图表的描述，而在考研英语中，图表作文还需要加入自己的观点，所以在这里会加入一些新的内容。

An estimated 2(1/2) hours were spent in serious discussion while 2 hours were devoted to everyday small-talk. Watching television accounted for 5(1/4) hours and listening to the radio 4(1/2) hours. Going to the cinema or theatre only accounted for an average of 3/4 hour per week.

自己拨弄的:

~~Overall, over-grazing, deforestation, and over-cultivation  are all significant causes of land degradation globally, but the causes of less productive land in specific regions varies, while all of the causes related to the human activity.~~

教师拨弄的:

Overall, while there are three main causes worldwide, the different regions are not affected equally by these (causes <- 省略), and notably, these causes are all linked to human activity.

worldwide, globally = on a global scale

As the pie chart shows, over-grazing poses a threat to worldwide land degradation, which accounts for 35%. Another big reason for land degradation is deforestation which takes up 30% of the total. Agriculture is responsible for more than 50 percent of less production land.

As the pie chart shows, **although** there are other factors lead**ing** to land degradation **on a global scale** (merely 7%), the farming of animal **appears to pose the greatest threat**, **at** up to 35%. However, **as**(used to say that although sth is true, what follows is also true) logging and cultivating crops are held accountable for a further 30% and 28%, respectively, it is clear that agriculture is the main culprit, causing more than half of all such problems.
