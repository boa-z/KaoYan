高中英语资料~

## I. Structure

*Part A: **Introductoryparagraph** 总起段（开头段）*

总起全文，提出议题，引出中心论点(topic sentence），勿兜圈子，开门见山说明作者观点

para1:（1）对所给材料（文字〉进行解释说明：（2）作者的明确观点

*Part B: **Supporting paragraphis**)推展段落*

必须层层递进，该段是整篇文章的重头戏，评分老师主要考虑给等第的关键段）。以"developing”的手法，目的是“supporting”作者的观点，有一定的说服力。（全篇文章的第二段我们称作：Body)

围绕中心论点进行论述，举出例子或阐明原因（Body 部分如写的长的话也可考虑酌情再分段。)出于高考作文给了参考宁数的规定，而且受时间的限制，一般不建议写的太长，通常Choice版块的议论文，段落尽量不超过4段。)在Body 部分，主要以argument stsupporting sentences。论点与论点之问需要有 transitional words 作为过渡及体现层次、

*Part C: **Concluding paragraph** 总结段*

总结观点，呼应论点，或也可提出措施、号召。（目的是再--次重申作者的观点，总结全文的重点，达到升华。）

III.学生范文

2017 届1月高考
假设你是明启中学的学生王磊，你的好友李宏今年暑假将赴英国参加为期四个月的海外交流活动。如果选择主办方安排的住宿，他需要额外支付较高的费用，但他也可以通过为当地社区养老院提供每月三十小时的义务工服务，获得在养老院免费住宿的机会，李宏通过邮件向你征求意见。写-封回信，内容须包括：你对此事的明确态度 & 你的理由。

参考范文 1

It's said that you will go abroad to England for a two-month oversea communication activity in this summer vocation. I hear that you hesitate whether spending higher price to choose arrangeddormitory or spending 30 hours every month to serve the old to get a free stay.

In my opinion, I think you should choose the first one. If you choose the second option, you will use too much time to do service instead of studying the local culture. Although communicating with the old can get a lot of live experience and avoid many mistakes in life, your most important responsibility is to learn how overseas students study and what they will learn. Arranged room can save you time and have more opportunities to live with peers who may share the same interest with you. By this, you can make a lot of young friends and if you are in trouble in future, they may give you some suggestions and a helping hand.

I wish that you would take my advice and I'm waiting to hear from you.
